#Database Engineering Project Utilizing Spotify API

~Overview~

This project involves the design and engineering of a PostgreSQL database utilizing the Spotify API. Its primary goal is to facilitate music data analysis, including exploration of track metadata, user preferences, and playlist information. The database is structured to efficiently handle queries related to music patterns, trends, and personalized recommendations.

~Interacting with the Database~

Use provided SQL scripts in the /queries directory to perform common analyses.

Custom queries can be created and executed through PostgreSQL client interfaces like psql or GUI tools such as pgAdmin.

~Ethical Considerations~

Careful ethical considerations were applied when interacting with the Spotify API. All data collected and stored in the database respects user privacy and adheres strictly to Spotify's API Terms of Service. Personal user data has been anonymized, and explicit consent mechanisms are in place where applicable. Data security measures, including restricted database access, have been implemented to prevent unauthorized usage.
